In this day and age, it might not be financially feasible for just one parent to have a significant job, so the question becomes a moot point. However, if one parent must stay at home with children, or one parent happens to make less money for whatever reason, it does not matter to me what the gender of the parent is. This is why I gave a neutral response: it might be the best option for one parent to not contribute as much to finances for reasons that aren't gendered.",60c15eb37d3334f63a66dcd4

My wife and I both worked full-time while raising our son, but we prioritized him in our off-time.  As a result we had, and still have, a very close relationship with him.

But not all parents would do so, for a myriad of reasons. I know of one couple where the dad actively dislikes being a parent because it takes away from his time.  Seems to me like if you're a parent, you need to put your feelings aside for a bit because your child can't wait.  A baby doesn't care if you want to play CoD or GTA - it knows what it wants, it NEEDS it right then.

I was brought up by parents who grew up in the Depression and were very 'hands off' when I would have liked to have been closer with them.  (Call it 'emotionally isolated'.)  So I decided to do things different as a dad, and I'm happy with the results.  I prioritized family over work quite a few times, but my boss was okay with me doing that because I didn't abuse the privilege.

This was an interesting survey.  Thank you!",62ffe399d769a8e595609133
